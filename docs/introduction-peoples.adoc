[[ardains]]
#### The Ardains

These creatures, similar to humans, but much more resistant, almost immortal, are those that the Gods created to make them as servants. This happened almost nine thousand years before the Battle of Mistarel, shortly after the creation of Tir Kavéras by Alceone and his followers. The Ardains were thus created in the image of the gods and received from them many faculties such as great resistance to wounds, diseases and other afflictions. Although not immortal in the true sense of the term, the Ardains usually live for nearly two hundred years, but some of them, through spiritual and corporal mastery, manage to break through the barriers of time and old age and such legendary figures roam the centuries. We know that Brenden Abrogine, current king of the Finlond de Valindor, has known the Battle of Mistarel and is more than 1,500 years old. But the most famous example is that of Queen Fithuil Erithel, sovereign of the Eniens of Veglénion, so old that she would have known the first divine city of Ambéra, more than five thousand years before BM! A true living memory of the world, the queen of Veglénion, however, lives away from everything in the depths of the Imladil forest and she has never met any human since the flight of her people in the crater of Veglénion.

In the south of Norvolan, or on the shores of Ovolan, the legend of the Wandering Ardain, Sanarole, is sometimes whispered. He would have been the first Ardain created by the Gods and would be in a way the grandfather of the whole race on the surface of Firmellan. Several legends tell that he would be truly immortal and that a dispute with the Gods in the time of Ambera would have led him in exile and on an eternal wandering on the surface of Firmellan. Gradually, the name of Sanarole was taken up in several other legends, always as a symbol of bad meeting; the Ardain would follow his own goals and it is not always be good to cross his path.

[[arenians]]
##### The Arenians

This is an Ardain tribe sedentary for a long time, having always lived in Tir Kavéras. These Ardains are originally a tribe chosen by Alceone and his followers to reside in his city. The Arenians are essentially a people of scholars and artists, entirely devoted to the cult of Alceone and his followers.

[[angrist]]
##### The Angrist

This is the name given to the Ardains who went to colonize the lands of the north and the east. Still more resistant than their ancestors, and stronger, the Angrists fought for many long generations against the Dark Gods, on all the frontiers of Desolation, which the ruins of their illustrious cities still haunt. Today most Angrist have found refuge in the southern Mirogrond Mountains, but many communities live in the Chargos or in the Cloud Mountains beyond the Kovsa Steppes. Their large dispersion on the surface of Firmellan has given birth to many very different customs between the different Angrist communities even though some fundamental traits remain.

[[elden]]
##### The Elden

This generic name applies to the elf tribes that roam on the surface of Firmellan. By extension, the Ardains are often called Elden. The dispersion of the Ardains began during the Fall, increased when the Gods left and at the beginning of the Black Age.

From Belgaroth to Chargos, from Norvolan to Origon, the Elden travel in large groups of several hundred people, dragging large wagons and sometimes herds. Some live from their stock, some other tribes live selling their services as scribes, warriors or magicians. Some roam in the year thousands of kilometres while others simply wander in a small region well defined. Still others eventually settle in and form isolated communities within large cities. In the cities of the Toleth Plains, there are many Elden districts where foreigners are not always welcome.

[[eniens]]
##### The Eniens

The Eniens are those Ardains who found refuge, after the Fall, in the crater of Véglénion. Long hidden, they did not reappear until the end of the Black Age when Hobgobelin troops ventured into their territory. Their queen, Fithuil Erithel, is one of the oldest creatures of Firmellan since she participated with the first Ardains in the divine council in the mythical city of Ambera!

Living very withdrawn, protecting like a sanctuary their great forest, they have however many exchanges with the Angrist of Mirogrond and the Havenorians. They have established two trading posts on their territory, Cedrin Vulë and Cedrin Olë, which are the only Véglénion points allowed to foreigners.

[[finlond]]
##### The Finlond

These Ardains settled very early on the southern continent, in the present-day Phar Mountains. There they learned the magic of Chaos from Lucida the Guardian. The Finlond are much bigger and stronger than average. They left Phar to join the Known World after the Fall. Today, the Finlond are an endangered people because their descendants were cursed at the end of the Black Age. The last Finlond, a few handfuls only, live on their Valindor lands.

The origin of the cursed curse goes back to the Battle of Mistarel, when all of these people, emboldened by their victory over the Black Hordes, wanted to pursue their enemies into the Desolation. There, the Dark Gods were on their territory, had at their disposal all their power and their counter-attack was terrible. It is said that more than two out of every three Finlands were slain, enslaved or converted to Yemlhem. The survivors could not resist the magical assaults of the Gods of Yûr who came to the rescue of their allies and suffered the curse that continues them today. For Finlonds, there is no hope: one day or another, a desire takes them, violent and uncontrollable, to go in the footsteps of their ancestors and return to the depths of the Desolation. Once they leave their homes in Valindor, they never see them again. This terrible curse has made Finlond, moreover a very great people of magician warriors, desperate and melancholy beings.

[[yemlhem]]
##### The Yemlhem

These Ardains, tall, pale and almost skeletal, are actually Finlond having been subject to the will of the Gods of Yûr at the end of the Black Age. Great wizards of the Non-Life, they are a true living legend because they almost never leave the fortresses of their masters. They are attributed, rightly or wrongly, great powers of black magic.

[[goblinoids]]
#### The Goblinoids

At the beginning of time, shortly before the Fall, openings to the Chaos brought to Firmellan a strange people, the Giants. Six to twelve meters tall, strong and stupid, they progressed blindly before them, destroying the works of the Gods and Ardains.

But some Gods wanted to make these creatures servants. The Giants being too stupid, they selected the best of them and made the current Trolls. The others were slaughtered and there are very few Giants left nowadays.

The Trolls were just a variety of giants among others and they were very stupid. So the Gods of Giants, as they were later called, used the characteristics of the Ardains to mix with those of the Trolls. Thus was born, in what is today the Desolation, the great race of Goblins. For this act, the Gods of the Giants were banished from the divine community and later, they would naturally associate with the Black Gods and the Gods of Yûr.

Worse, during the Dark Ages, the Giants' gods further refined the Goblin race by crossing them, by nature and magic, to humans and Ardians. The products of these crossings were the Orcs and the Hobgoblins, the most numerous of their servants, providing the bulk of the armies composing the Black Horde.

[[giants]]
##### Giants

These nightmare creatures, enormous and grotesque caricatures of human beings, have become very rare. After the massacre perpetrated by the Gods of the Giants, these creatures dispersed on the surface of Firmellan, in isolated places. Being unable to reproduce, they disappear progressively even if they can live several thousands of years.

Today, we only talk about them in legends. Thus, there is the Augrol Giant, who would live along the <<sarn-pass,Sarn Pass>>, devouring those who venture into the hills. There would also be the Big Paul, a joker and clumsy giant, who would take up residence in the forests of South Asman in Origon. More ominous, but also further, it is said that a family of Giants, the Jaho, would live in the Ord Marshes, only going out to devour whole villages.

Six to twelve meters tall, the Giants have almost no trait in common, except their vague humanoid aspect and incredible stupidity.

[[trolls]]
##### Trolls

Trolls are just a variety of <<giants,Giants>>, stabilized by divine magic. Able to reproduce, their fertility is however very small and their number has never been enough for the Black Gods to make armies out of them. Trolls are a little smarter than their cousins and are able to obey simple orders as long as they are promised meat. Guided by Goblins, whom they fear enormously, the Trolls form within the Black Hordes small shock units. The Trolls are like humans, twelve feet tall, huddled together, with grotesque, bestial features, huge, prominent teeth. Handling huge clubs, sometimes real tree trunks, they like to rush over their opponents without any consideration of tactics or caution.

There are few independent Trolls. Most live in the Desolation or in <<hoornal,Hoornal>> at the service of the Black Gods and Giant Gods. Some live however in the Ord Marshes, real slaves of the local Goblins.

[[goblins]]
##### Goblins

Measuring up to three meters tall, goblins are like humans (or <<ardains,Ardains>>) massive, grey or with a whitish skin, having very abundant hair that they weave in many clever ways to make armour.

Much more intelligent than the Trolls, they are the elite armies of the Black Horde. Able to organize, they are sometimes completely independent of their divine masters and are not always evil. In the heart of the Ord Marshes, the goblins built many villages and founded a true civilization, living from the sale of metals and the traffic of Theolithe. Skilled blacksmiths, Goblins are also vaguely magicians and have created in the past legendary weapons, including the famous hammer Azurbal, able to smash rocks and send lightning.

[[hobgoblins]]
##### The Hobgoblins

Created from magic and monstrous couplings between Goblins, Humans and Ardains, the Hobgoblins or Orcs are the most common Goblinoid variety on Firmellan. A little larger and stronger than Humans, as much as the Finlond, they make up the bulk of the Black Horde's troops. Their white, scabbed skin, their large teeth and the claws they have on their fingers make them easily recognizable, but with a disguise effort, they can go almost unnoticed in the middle of a human community.
Hobgoblin communities can be found everywhere on Firmellan, in places where they are safe from Humans and Ardains. Of course, they are the most numerous in the Desolation, in Hoornal and Hoortnog, but they are also found in the mountains of the island of Sébanarole, in the Lucerne Country or in the north of <<ne-hebel,Né-Hébel>>.

[[ogres]]
##### The Ogres

The Hobgoblins are able to have a decent with humans but not with the Ardains. The result of such unions, rarely consented, is a hybrid being, who cannot have descendants. They are called Ogres. They look like normal humans most of the time, except that their skin is whiter than usual, that their nails are more resistant and that they are a little stronger and more resistant than average. These Ogres are generally rejected by both communities and live like outcasts.

[[jabelins]]
##### The Jabelins

At the time of the <<hobgoblins,Hobgoblins>>' creation, a fraction of the new creatures rebelled against their divine creators and fled the Desolation, directing their steps to the north. There, to escape the wrath of the Gods of the Giants, they ventured into the icy lands and experienced several centuries of wandering there. They ended up finding refuge beyond the oceans, between the sea and the Sparkling Mountains. Only the navigators of <<vetermjord,Vetermjord>> have been in contact with them at the moment.

The Jabelins are Hobgoblins whose features bring them closer to the Ardains and Humans than Goblins. They are less stocky than their ancestors and their skin does not have the sickly pallor of Hobgoblins. However, their facies remain heavy, especially at the level of the eyebrows.

[[humans]]
#### Humans

The Humans appeared on Firmellan very shortly after the Fall, certainly on the island of Sébanarole, as evidenced by the antiquity of the cities of Norvolan. The capital of the island empire is indeed the oldest city of human origin, and the second metropolis of Firmellan after Tir Kavéras.

The exact origins of these people are unclear, but most scholarly works agree that Humans may have come from the Outer Worlds thanks to the collision of the Block which caused the appearance of Karkater's crater. There, these creatures, more fragile than the Ardains, would have survived with difficulty in the tormented landscapes of the crater. Forced to survive, they would have forgotten everything about their past and would have survived only with the help of Elden tribes returned to the island of Sébanarole after the cataclysm. The extreme human fertility caused the race to spread very rapidly over Firmellan and they quickly outnumbered the Ardains. However, the Ardains have largely, if not totally, influenced the culture of Humans.

Despite many legends, it seems that Humans and Ardains cannot have common descent. There are, however, several Ardain - Human couples around the world because the two races can sometimes get along very well. The difference in longevity and resistance sometimes distances them and may even lead to situations of exacerbated racism, such as between the Nesh and Fenndsor countries.

Since the Battle of Mistarel, and even more after the Great War of Men, Men have become the true masters of Firmellan and the Ardains appear in the history of the world only episodically.

[[dragons]]
#### The Dragons

Among the great people of Firmellan, one of them holds a place apart: this is the big dragon family. The Dragons resemble, most of the time because they can often change their shape to a certain extent, to large lizards with hard and shiny scales, with membranous wings. The largest of the Dragons are two hundred meters long, from the barbed head to the serrated tail with dangerous ridges, but most of them are between twenty and thirty meters long. If they are able to fly, this faculty is not conferred on them by their wings but rather by the use of a magic of their own and close to that of the Magicians of Chaos. Dragons are able to change shape: their wings can disappear, their proportions can evolve and they can evolve on their hind legs in the manner of humans. The legend that says they can even take human form is probably an invention but has never been confirmed or overturned.

In addition to their formidable fighting abilities, the Dragons are able to speak, in a language of their own, to practice the magic of Chaos with disconcerting ease and are known for their use of the Breath. This ability is certainly due to a very particular use of an invocation of Chaos Magic: the Dragon becomes haloed by flames and clouds, causing to people who are engulfed there burns, deformations or haemorrhages. It is an excessively terrifying and destructive weapon.

If we add to that a natural armour resistant to almost everything, we understand that the Dragons are formidable fighters!
 
There are six colours of Dragons: Blues, Azures, Greens, Reds, Purples and Golden. To each corresponds a particular behavioural tendency. Magicians and scholars have long noticed the strange connection between dragon colours and Firmellan Stones. From there to supposing that the existence of some is due to that of others, there is only one step ... Similarly, some suppose the existence of a seventh dragon colour, the White, associated with the Light Stone.

The Dragons appeared on the surface of Firmellan nearly two thousand years before the Battle of Mistarel. They appeared in great numbers, and suddenly, in all the southern parts of Firmellan without being able to give them an exact origin. Endowed with language, the Dragons, after waiting for the fear of their coming to dissipate, contacted the Humans and Ardains to signify an alliance against the Dark Gods and the Creatures of Darkness from the Desolation. Then began the heroic ages ranging from the fifteenth century before BM to the early Black Age, when united, Humans, Ardains and Dragons fought against the Black Hordes. Incredible stone fortresses were built in the mountains, those of Sébanarole, those of Véglénion, those of Nogra in the old Hastir, to welcome the Dragons, their allies and their servants. Today, only their majestic and impressive ruins remain.
 
The story of the Dragons is marked by two facts which are called the First and Second Schisms.

The First Schism occurred in the fourteenth century before BM. Following the subjection of the humans of northern Mung to the Black Hordes, the Allies had to first confront their brothers. Many Dragons, almost three out of four said the legend, then refused to pursue further their struggle and left the Known World. Here begins the legend of the Dragons of the Refusal. More than a million Dragons moved south to an unknown destination. It is said that they settled for a time in the Eklem Islands before fleeing again to the South Continent. Then, their track is lost forever… Only a few anecdotal and contradictory legends circulate about them. It is said, however, that they would live on the margins of Firmellan's world, and that they will return one day, to save their old allies from immense danger.

The Second Schism marks the beginning of the Black Age and has the same cause as the Cataclysm that struck Hastir off the map. Towards the year 1000 before BM, a sorcerer named Aturdane, extremely powerful and at the service of the Dark Gods, realized, in the capital of the conquered Hastir, Ambroquian, a terrifying spell. No one knows exactly what Aturdane really wanted to accomplish in the Temple of Mirofrans, a true jewel of Hastir's refined architecture, but the effects of his magic were devastating. A wave of magic and fire ravaged the country for thousands of miles, blowing away the pearl of all kingdoms ever founded by humans. Today, there remains only a vast haunted desert, the Ne-Hebel. But this incredible spell also had another effect, and maybe that was his true purpose. The Dragons still allied with the Humans and the Ardains were seized with a violent and bloodthirsty madness. The Dragons Orders founded in previous centuries were destroyed by this sudden betrayal and worse, many Dragons left their old allies to serve their former enemies. Among these returned Dragons, there were mostly Red Dragons and Golden Dragons. The Greens, the Blues and the Azur scattered around the world; only the Purples remained for a time in the service of the Allies before the successes of the Black Hordes put an end to the Alliance.

Throughout the Black Age, until the third century BM, the Dragons were opposed to humans and Ardains. The secret of the Alliance with the Dragons, however, was not condemned to be lost forever since it was reborn in -245 with the Revelation of the Gods Knights and the creation of the Draconian Order in the service of Havenor. Thanks to the intervention of a god, the mysterious Azard, a handful of Humans could find and control the last few Firmellan's Purple Dragons, thus renewing the formidable Alliance that had enabled Humans and Ardains to fight the Black Hordes in the past.

One time installed in <<hanrgonion,Hanrgonion>> mountains, the Order of the Dragon found its final home in the fifth century, when it settled in an old citadel draconic, south of <<norion,Norion>>.
