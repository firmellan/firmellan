## The Known World

On Firmellan, scholars and cartographers are accustomed to designate under the name of “Known World” all the civilized lands that extend from the Great Western Ocean to the <<great-sea-of-trees,Great Sea of Trees>>. We also add these two countries of the end of the world that are Sandokor and the empire of <<kotei,Kotei>>. North of <<origin,Origon>> and the <<chargos,Countries of Chargos>>, it is the Icy North, which is distinct from the “known world” and which is nevertheless part of the same continent.
