[[introduction-history]]
### A brief history of Firmellan

In the history of Havenor, several dates were taken in turn as references. The first used was the date of the creation of the city of Alceone, future Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM), in all the chronic slates.

Subsequently, the Fall (4315 BM) was considered a new start of the calendar although some Elden peoples consider the period of the Exile of the Gods (3004 BM) to be more valid.

Today, only one date is used as a reference: the Battle of Mistarel (BM). This titanic fight decided the fate of the world and marks the defeat of the Dark Gods against the United Humans and Ardains.

Historians, whether from Tir Kaveras or elsewhere, have become accustomed to viewing the history of the world from the perspective of eight great ages.

The Age of the Gods extends from the creation of the world (or since the arrival of the divinities on Firmellan) until the creation of the Ardains and the foundation of Tir Kavéras. The gods have left no archive or less written record (except the mythical tablets of Qsiros), their city of Ambera, having completely disappeared, this period is extremely vague, closer to mythology than history.

The Ardains dominate all the time which goes from the foundation of Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM) until the Fall. This period is therefore aptly named the Age of the Ardains even though they remain the faithful servants of their divine creators.

The Fall is a cataclysmic event, the extent of which certainly did not last more than a few days or weeks, in 4315 BC But we give its name to the chaotic and uncertain era that separates this catastrophe from the Exile of the Gods (-3004).

The Hastir Age begins in the 30th century before BM with the birth of the first great human kingdoms south of Hoortnog (Kaarmyin then Hastir in the 26th century)... It is also called the Age of the Struggle. It is indeed marked by the rise and the glory of Hastir, by the alliance of Humans, Ardains and Dragons against the Dark Gods but also by the omnipresence of the magical forces on the world. The greatest magicians of history have indeed lived at this time. One of them, Aturdane, will put an end to this period by the total destruction of Hastir and the Second Draconic Schism, which ended the Alliance.

In the mentalities of the inhabitants of Firmellan, the Black Age still marks many consciences. Spread over more than ten centuries, it is synonymous with the annihilation of all the liberties and domination of the Black Gods throughout the known world. Starting with the sudden death of Hastir and Second Schism of the Dragons at the end of the eleventh century before BM (certainly -1026), it ends at the Battle of Mistarel (year zero).

Although Havenor is still the largest nation in the world of Firmellan, in terms of power and influence, it is considered that it was once more powerful, enough in any case to give its name to a whole period. The Age of Havenor begins during the Battle of Mistarel (year zero) but several books place the beginning of this period in -235, at the time of the revelation of the Knights Gods.

The Great War of Men, the second global confrontation of Humans and Ardains against the Dark Gods, begins in 762, during the assault of the Black Hordes against Origon but some historians do it begins in 765, date of the capture of Telabeth, even in 770, date of the beginning of the siege of Tir Kavéras.

The present era (1383 after BM) is included in what is called the Modern Times. They officially begin in 855, date of the Battles of the Toleth which marked the victory of the Knights of Havenor on the Black Hordes and the end of the Great War of the Men.

[[introduction-age-of-the-gods]]
#### The Age of the Gods

No chronicle, no story or even no legend tells the beginnings of Firmellan. The only information available is fragmentary, gleaned by the Ardains from the Gods of the time of their glory.
For example, no one knows if Firmellan was created by the Gods or if they just settled there. This theological questioning still divides the priests, even within the same cult. But direct testimonies collected from the Dark Gods by the Meïktal priests seem to corroborate the second hypothesis, that of the arrival of the Gods of Firmellan more than a hundred centuries ago. But these testimonies are obviously questionable.
Without speaking of the origin of the Gods, several facts are proved by the different chronic slates. The Gods would have contributed to create many varieties of fauna and flora on Firmellan, until ending with their masterpiece, the creation of the Ardains. They built an immense city in the heart of the world, the mythical Ambera, which has now been lost. We must not forget that the Gods of Firmellan are very numerous, certainly more than five thousand, and they formed a true civilisation. According to the early Ardains, the gods formed families and some births, very rare however, are reported. Of course, throughout this population, many divinities were detached from others by their influence and power. There were in particular three, Mirofrans, Alantéis and Yemorlane, who formed the Triad, the governing body of life in Ambera.
Since that time, the divine people have known dissensions. First, there are Gods who did not want to live in Ambera and went exploring the big world. Later, deprived of worshipers, they faded away little by little and their names were forgotten. These gods are called Zephyr Gods and it is said that one can hear their words in the sigh of the wind in the desert regions.
Twelve gods, Alcéone and his followers, went south on the shores of the Southern Ocean, where the island of Sebanarole did not yet exist, and founded a second divine city: the future Tir Kavéras. Alcéone made it a haven of beauty and the centre of his creative work. He returned to Ambera, however, when the time came for the creation of the Ardains.
 
More disturbing, announcing all the misfortunes to come, a group of about fifty Gods, perhaps more, went to the north, driven out of Ambera by their peers. They had committed the crime of conducting magical experiments that had gone wrong. These gods of Yûr, from the name of the domain they founded in the north, were eager to know and had explored many areas of knowledge. Always more adventurous, they opened the doors to unholy knowledge: the control of the forces of Non-Life, antithesis of all that the Gods of Ambera were trying to build on Firmellan.
In the beginning, the Gods of Yûr, led by Justan and Edern, only sought to increase their knowledge, but their exile led them to pursue other goals, of which revenge was certainly part. But the Gods of Ambera were still too many and too strong; the Gods of Yûr knew to be patient. They led, however, terrifying experiences in the north of the world and ruined so much that country that it was called later the Desolation, a true region of nightmare, haunted the grotesque creations of Non-Life.
 
Nearly nine thousand years before BM, the Gods decided to create their masterpiece, a race of servants charged with worshiping them. In the heart of Ambera, the Gods set to work and created the Ardains. The gods were so pleased with their work that they decided to take their appearance. So the true aspect of the Ancient Gods was definitely lost. One can however think, given the forms that the Black Gods willingly borrow, that they must have been very varied.

[[introduction-ardain-ages]]

### The Ardains Ages
The Ardains, servants of the Gods, dispersed on the surface of Firmellan. Most remained around Ambera or occupied Tir Kavéras, but others went far away, to the ends of the world and their appearance changed in strength and rigor; they were named Angrist or Dwarves. They would only return to the Known World after the Fall.

The Age of the Ardains knew innumerable wonders. The cities founded by these children of the Gods were truly beautiful, and even their present ruins are never without giving a pinch to the heart of those who contemplate them in the evening light. Only the city of Alcéone and the city of Ardain, in the center of Tir Kavéras, are reflections of what once was the marvellous beauty of the ancient cities.

At that time, cultures scarcely extended beyond the walls of cities and the world was largely wild. The Ardains, like the Gods, only slowly reproduced themselves and their number was limited. Wars were also non-existent and the Ardains did not learn the art of combat before much later, when the time came for clashes with the Dark Gods and their creatures.
 
More than three thousand years passed on the surface of Firmellan. Like a distant storm, the Gods of Yûr still only probed the secrets of Non-Life in their buried fortresses. This situation could have lasted forever if an event, totally unpredictable, even by the Gods, had not come to destroy everything...

Nearly six thousand years before BM, the chronic slates signal the appearance of several unusual phenomena. From the north came first enormous and grotesque creatures with vaguely anthropomorphic features; they were advancing blindly, ruining everything in their path. On top of that, strange moving lights appeared in the heavens and turned out to be gigantic balls of molten rock swirling at high speed. As if that were not enough, a strange coloured fog appeared at the eastern borders of the world, chasing the Angrist people before him. When it finally dissipated, it gave way to a country plagued by magic and chaos. It progressed towards the west, assimilating as it was the reality of the Firmellan world. Faced with this threat, the Gods mobilized their powers for the second time and created a huge barrier to protect themselves   These Dreamlands sank more than two thousand meters into the ground.
 
The Giants were approaching more and more of the inhabited lands of Firmellan; the gods sent a group of theirs to arrest them. There were certainly some fights, the first since the beginning of the history, but the Giants proved easily controllable by magic. A group of deities, thirty in number, even took them under their protection and undertook to make them servants, as well as the Ardains. But the Giants did not suit this purpose at all because their stupidity was too big. So the Gods of Giants selected the best of them and changed them by magic to make Trolls, less powerful but more intelligent. As for the other Giants, they were almost exterminated by the Gods; only a few of them survive today.
To refine the Trolls, the Gods of the Giants undertook an abominable realization: they mixed the characteristics of these creatures with those of the Ardains. The goblin race was born. This act was, however, regarded with horror by the Gods of Ambera and the Gods of the Giants were driven out of the divine community.
The creators of the Trolls and Goblins never understood this decision because for them, the Ardains were the work of Gods like the Goblins. So they left in the north.
As a result of all these harmful events, a great council, bringing together the Ardain chiefs and the gods, was organized at Ambera. Fithuil Erithel, current queen of the Enien (Elves of Véglénion nowadays), was there and testified of the decisions in her chronicles. To find the cause of all these phenomena, emissaries were sent to the four corners of the world.
When they returned, they said they had found that many breaches had been opened between Firmellan and other universes, allowing the Chaos and some creatures to enter the world, threatening its very existence.

Now that the Dreamlands had been isolated from the world, the Giants had been mastered, and the Blocks continued their celestial course without threatening anyone, the Gods judged that the danger had passed. Many of theirs, however, were sent to the South to fill the open breaches to Chaos or other universes. What these envoys and scholars discovered in the south, no chronic chronicle tells it. What they reveal, however, is that the danger was really present. For a single message returned from the south, Antear, who was the first of the Gods Dead, at least to be recognized as such. This young god returned from the far south and revealed his secret to the Triad, who thought it best to send an army this time south. Nothing is known except that this period marks the decline of Ambera and the expansion of the Gods of Yûr towards the north where they created the Desolation.

[[introduction-fall]]
#### The fall

In the year 4315 took place the Fall of Blocks. Centuries after centuries, the Blocks were dangerously close to the surface and one night, some hit the surface of Firmellan. The cataclysm was unimaginable. The few Ardains who have known this period speak of it with words of terror and stupefaction. Huge mountain ranges were raised  affected by the impacts, wiping out nearly eight-tenths of the population. Huge craters opened like monstrous flowers on the surface of Firmellan, unleashing the fires of the depths. Many cities were sunk or blown away, none escaped without damage. Huge waves of fire, water and dust ran through the land. The landscape of Firmellan was forever upset.

When the Blocks had stopped falling, the Ardains, abandoned by Gods who had too much to do on their side, left their cities and began to wander on the surface. The only ones spared by the Cataclysm, the Arenians of Tir Kavéras welcomed many refugees. The others became the Elden, the Wanderers. Subsequently, some settled in new countries, such as Nesh or Véglénion.
 
The chronicles following the Fall are both rare and uninformative. Most of the time they relate to local events, and the gods almost disappear from the stories. It seems nevertheless that a Second Council took place in Ambera and that it was decided to create (or to bring back according to the versions) the Seven Stones.

In these artefacts, the Gods invested all their power, for the third time and last time. Doing so, they forbade themselves forever to stay on Firmellan. Some gods could not consent to such a sacrifice and did not participate in what is known as the Seven Stones Quest. Accused of treason, they were driven out of Ambera and went to join the Gods of Yûr; they became the Black Gods, symbols of opposition to the will of the other gods.

When the Seven Stones were ready, the Gods unleashed their power! This had the effect of stabilizing the course of the Blocks and consolidating the barriers of the Firmellan universe. The Seven Stones century scattered across the world, the Gods of Ambera destroyed their city (or it was destroyed by the magic of the Seven Stones depending on the version) and left for the heavens, where they established the stars as their homes. From now on, they could only act through faithful servants who draw their magical powers from the energies dispensed on the surface of Firmellan by the Seven Stones.
 
For their part, the Black Gods, the Gods of Yûr and the Gods of the Giants were free from all obstacles and were able to realize their dreams of domination. From the beginning, the Black Gods imposed themselves as the leaders of this coalition because those of Yûr, in spite of their power, were not numerous enough and the Gods of Giants, like their servants Trolls and Goblins, had become stupid, angry and undisciplined.
 
The years following the Fall are also marked by the appearance on Firmellan of a new race, the Humans. Appearing on the new island of Sébanarole, they had to live in hostile conditions for several centuries. Having to survive from day to day, the people of Humans gradually lost all memory of their origin even if most think they came from another world, during a tear caused by the Fall between the universe.

Several tribes or clans survived somehow in the mountains of Karkater before descending to the valleys of Norvolan and founding a semblance of civilization. It was there that they came into contact with Elden from the neighbouring continent and learned from them (or re-learned) all the arts that make up the present human civilization. Their fertility being considerably higher than that of the Ardains, humans were not long in leaving Norvolan to explore new horizons. For many centuries, their territories and kingdoms extended mainly north of the Sepp Strait; their development to the east and west would only begin much later.

[[introduction-hastir]]
#### The Age of Hastir

It was therefore in the north of the present-day Ne-Hebel, under the shadow of the Dark Gods, that the Humans settled in numbers. To the south, the nation of Norvolan was certainly flourishing, but it is to the north that the glory of the Humans was most to shine.

One of the earliest known human kingdoms is Kaarmyin, founded between the left bank of the Sog and the now extinct Sea of ​​Rain. In the north of the kingdom, a city was to remain the capital for many centuries: Golem.

East of the Sog, around the Natérel, an inland sea where many rivers found their destination, another kingdom was born, whose name would resonate in history with glory and enlightment: Hastir. These territories, between Hoortnog in the north and the Straits of Sepp in the south, were for several generations broken up into numerous fiefs and tribes. The unification of these pieces of territory was probably made around -2500. In fact, only the lands of Kaarmyin escaped this nascent empire.
Covering all the lands around the Natérel, crossing the Sog Range, medium mountains now reduced to nipples eroded by the desert, overlooking the former Irenimélan, Hastir was a centralized kingdom around its capital Ambroquian. According to the many Ardain archives, Hastir would have had a king at his head but the regime of the kingdom would have changed many times, from a constitutional monarchy to a totalitarian empire over the centuries.

It is difficult today to imagine what could be Hastir's aura in the pre-Black Age world. Outside the lands that the kingdom controlled, the world was largely returned to the wild. The Elden had abandoned their country and wandered around the world. Only Norvolan and Ovolan, where the Arenians carried the torch of civilization, showed an evolution comparable, if not less, to the one of Hastir.

Around the Natérel, the Hastiris built large cities of stone, they also traced a paved road that went from Ambroquian to Kokarti, circling the sea from the north, for more than eight hundred kilometres. Peace and prosperity reigned over this part of the world for nearly a thousand years.
 
But this peace owed its existence to a never ending bitter struggle against the Black Gods and their allies. The people of Hastir, helped by the Ardains, had created an alliance with the Dragons from the South. Together, they constituted the Draconic Orders, scattered on a line of defence that went from the Great Ocean to the Sea of ​​Chargos. But the main front was north of Hastir. The Dragons, supported by the armies of Hastir, the Ardain warriors and the magicians of Ambroquian, were thus careful to contain, year after year, the assaults of the Black Gods. Of course, this struggle did not keep the same intensity all the time; she had ups and downs, just as Hastir sometimes had to concede ground. But overall, the situation remained stable between Hoortnog and Hastir.
 
The period of struggle against Hoortnog also sees the appearance of magicians in increasing numbers. Initially trained with the Ardain elders and especially with the Dragons, the knowledge continued to grow as the years went by. The power of magicians became so important that the fighting between them and the creatures Black Gods eventually ruined the country in which it was held. Worse, following many betrayals, magical knowledge gradually passed on the side of the Dark Gods. The Hastiris reacted by creating a real industry of magic, allowing a maximum of talents to see the day. The temple of Mirofrans seemed to have been the place where all the magical knowledge of the time was collected. Even though the Mirofrans God has never been formally associated with magic ... Nevertheless, according to several engravings or slates, we know the appearance of this “temple of magic”: a large cupola, wider than it is high, framed by six slender minarets.

It is in this high place of the magic that appeared, at the beginning of 12th century the mage known under the name of Fustabane, one of the greatest wizards having ever existed.
 
While the 12th and early 11th century before BM were marked by the struggle of Fustabane agains the Black Gods. True leader of the free world, he became the number one enemy of Hoortnog after all the success he won. It is even said that he, a mortal, managed to imprison a Dark God in person. Thanks to Fustabane, Hastir's kingdom saw the struggle being fought on the very territory of the Dark Gods, in the Dark Marches and around Samnakan's citadel. This citadel was even completely isolated when the armies of Hastir, led by Fustabane, managed to take control of the Damnation Road.

The Dark Gods reacted by creating the Kherenstris, a monster born of magic, a vast dark shadow, carving the black silhouette of a dragon on the sky. Tamed and ridden by the Black God Hornshass, the Kherenstris rushed to attack the armies of Hastir. Carrying his attacks wherever Fustabane was not present, he caused enormous damage before the Archimage could come to meet him.

The first fight took place on the banks of the Natérel; following a merciless fight in which Fustabane was helped by a great golden dragon named Uycante, the city of Corian was completely razed. Seeing the extent of the disaster, due to the intensity of the magical forces that were deployed during the fight, Fustabane made a decision that would change the destiny of the whole world. To spare Hastir from the destruction which his battle with Kherenstris might entail, the magician resolved to flee north to the Desolation, and to draw with him the monster and his rider. The ruse functioned and the two dragons, the Shadow and the Light, went to the ends of the world. No one ever heard of Fustabane any more than of Kherenstris. The threat had moved away from Hastir but had left the kingdom without a defender. From now on, the country of Natérel was delivered to the hordes come from Hoortnog and Hoornal. The neighbouring cities of the Inland Sea soon fell under the blows of Goblin armies; then came Kaarmyin's turn. The Sog cities, supported by the Dragons and the Ardains, resisted and the Black Hordes could not cross the Sog barrier mountains.
 
A new power settled in Ambroquian, capital of Hastir. Submitted to Hokromûr, a council of mages establishes its residence in the former Temple of Mirofrans and established an iron dictatorship on all the former territory of Hastir. At the head of this council appeared a name that would also remain in the history: Aturdane.

This magician, still young at the time of Fustabane's fight against Kherenstris, was one of the most talented of his generation. Magic flowed in him like blood, and there were many creatures from all over the world who owed him obedience. No one knows exactly how this mage-born came to serve the Dark Gods; we only know that he was trained at Ambroquian and that he could have become one of Fustabane's pupils if fate had not decided otherwise. Probably kidnapped and enslaved as a result of a raid of Black Hordes on the banks of the Natérel, Aturdane spent many years in captivity on the heights of the plateau of Lâg. But one cannot reduce to a simple bondage a born-mage and Aturdane was not long to be noticed by his supervisors, then, still higher, by the Black Gods themselves. Confirmed in his art, Aturdane took up the cause of his old jailers. Some historians attribute this allegiance to considerable pressure, others to the attraction of gain. Others finally mention the existence of a hostage remains in the hands of the Gods of Hoortnog.

When Fustabane abandoned Hastir and the Black Hordes seized the entire Natérel kingdom, Aturdane settled in Ambroquian and became the representative of the Black Gods and the undisputed leader of the region.

In the south, on the banks of the Sog, the resistance was organized. The last representatives of Hastir, their Ardain allies and the Dragons formed one of the greatest alliance the world has ever known. Armed with the power of their armies and their magical powers, this coalition managed to regain full control of the south of Kaarmyin and to dominate all the heights of the Sog Range. At that time, according to old Ardain accounts, no one could see how the Black Hordes could resist such forces. It was without counting the power of Aturdane. At the heart of his Ambroquian temple, the magician conceived a spell of incredible power. The power released was such that some magicians believe that at least one Firmellan stone had to intervene in its elaboration.

One summer morning that year, a wave of dust and fire fell on Hastir, from Lâg to the Sepp Strait, from Golem to Mung, erasing all traces of civilization and life. At the same time, all the Dragons were seized with deadly frenzy and turned onto their former allies. The alliance that was to save Hastir from the Black Hordes had lived, as had the country they wanted to deliver...

In the days that followed, many Dragons died or were killed; others joined the Black Hordes.
The others sank into oblivion: they would only return more than a thousand years later. 

As for the kingdom of Hastir, it was now only a vast expanse of sand and dust. The blue waters of Naterel had given way to a plain of greyish salt. Ruined by fire and magic, neither man nor beast ventured into what was henceforth called the Né-Hébel : the “country of nobody”.
 
Deprived of the help of the Dragons, the Humans and the Ardains suffered defeats after defeats against the Black Hordes. On all fronts, they had to give ground until they had to take refuge in the divine city of Tir Kavéras. The Black Age of the World had begun.

[[introduction-black-age]]
#### The Black Age

In the memory of all the peoples of Firmellan, the Black Age has left many traces, in the form of a cloud obscuring nearly a thousand years of life on the surface of the world. Surrounded by the Black Hordes across the continent, from west to east, the human and their Ardain allies had been able to find refuge only in Ovolan, well defended by the Stone Pass and the Marshes of Ord . Las! this protection hardly lasted and soon the free world was reduced to the only enclosure of Tir Kavéras.

City built by the Gods in the time of their splendor, Tir Kavéras survived for eight long centuries, because of the exceptional courage of its inhabitants, generations after generations, as well as and of the magical protection brought by his white walls, protection that also extended in the air and sea. No one could cross this barrier if it was animated by intentions hostile to the city; likewise, any infection or disease could not overcome this impalpable limit despite the innumerable attempts of agents of the Black Gods.
 
Despite the undeniable symbol of Tir Kaveras throughout the Black Age, it would be incorrect to say that it was the only place of resistance. Indeed, it is often forgotten that the resistance of the city could spread over several centuries, without the inhabitants suffering from scarcity or hunger, only because the kingdom of Norvolan was spared. The merchants of this nation, who had lately appeared, kept control of the oceans all the time and were always able to supply the city with food, equipment and weapons. The debt incurred by the city of Tir Kavéras, and by extension, the free world, towards Norvolan cannot be counted in terms of money. Even today, the divine city maintains privileged relations with the empire of the other side of the Sepp Strait.

Before the year -120, the Norvolan empire did not exist yet and was a mosaic of small states, sometimes allies, often at war. The Sébanarole Peninsula, throughout the Black Age, received many refugees from the mainland and this massive influx of people had two consequences: a chronic instability of the country and the disappearance of the old civilization of Norvolan, which went back to the first ages of humanity. Even the language of Norvolan ended up completely disappearing to become a dialect derived from Larne spoken on the continent. 
 
Outside Norvolan and Tir Kavéras, the islets of resistance to the Black Hordes were almost non-existent. Certainly, at the edge of the world, on the shores of the Chargos Sea in particular, the influence of the Black Gods was minimal, but it was more because the Black Hordes had lost interest in these regions than because a resistance was there. active.

Humans and Ardains, however, did not disappear from the surface of the world: sometimes enslaved, they were content most of the time to undergo the yoke of their divine masters. In fact, the Black Gods were more often absent than present in the direction of world affairs; they were found more in their areas of Hoortnog or, more rarely, at the siege of Tir Kavéras. Thus, the nations were most often led by the lieutenants of the Black Gods, goblins or sometimes even humans who had rallied the cause of the Dark Gods. When the Hobgoblins made their appearance, they quickly formed the bulk of the Black Gods' armies and their communities settled in many places, including Origon, in the ancient cities of Angrist.

Far from the theatre of war operations, people lived relatively well, in spite of the legends that make this period a nightmare. People eventually adapted to the new powers in place even if the leaders were most often tyrants and despots, not very concerned about the welfare of their subjects. This situation was often aggravated by the innumerable dissensions existing between the various “kinglets” which, far from the divine authority, sought to carve themselves real kingdoms. The war raged sporadically, dragging its procession of plunder, misery and epidemics.   

Sometimes, a Black God returned to his lands and did the housework, becoming at the same time a saviour in the eyes of local people!

So if humans sometimes lived properly under the tutelage of the Black Gods, the Ardains did not have this chance. Systematically persecuted, killed or reduced to slavery, the Ardains remained the enemies of the Dark Gods and got their salvation only by seeking asile in Tir Kavéras, by escaping from the Known World or by their fierce resistance in easily defendable places. There, they sometimes resisted for centuries, gradually being forgotten by their enemies. The Black Age was the period when the Elden entered the legend, these eternal Ardain nomads avoiding cities and walking once night fell, masters of deep forests, dark valleys and magic.
 
The Black Age spanned several centuries, several generations; it largely shaped the history of men and most of the legends that are told today date back from that time. From the ages before the arrival of the Dark Gods, there remains only a mist, from which emerge only Hastir or the memory of a period free of misfortunes, considered as the Golden Age of Firmellan.

The Black Age was also the one of magic. Not being subject to any control at all, both sides loosened the bridle to the powers of their magicians. The old knowledge from Hastir was put to use and horrible magical battles took place. The magicians acquired so much power that they became masters of their destinies and eventually escaped control, even from the Dark Gods. Especially in Origon, where they regrouped to form a third force opposed to the Hoortnog domination. Paradoxically, it is the emergence of this ephemeral theocracy and the ensuing struggle between it and the Black Hordes that explains that the south of the continent was partially stripped of its forces at the time of the Revelation.

This magiocracy of Nehr, named after one of his most famous wizards, only survived the time of a generation because his stability didn’t resist internal dissension between the wizards. Only the intervention of some Black Gods in person brought the coup de grace to an already moribund organization. The survivors then ranged to one side or the other. Their successors managed to retain some of the knowledge of their elders, from Hastir's old mysteries, and actively participated in the Battle of Mistarel. Their distant descendants would become, much later, the founders of the Ring of Glantr.

[[introduction-black-age-revelation]]
##### The revelation

The Revelation took place in the year 245 before the Battle of Mistarel in the city of Tir Kavéras when Twelve divinities were revealed to the descendants of the kings of a small kingdom before the Dark Ages: Havenor. 

Armed with magical powers, the five orders of warrior priesthood that resulted from this divine appointment managed to set up an effective counter-attack force and to gather a large army around them.

So it was 245 BC before the actual foundation of what would later become the Havenor Empire. From then on, the leaders of this people in exile would become the leaders of the free world. This preeminent position would always be contested, but nevertheless, in the city of Tir Kavéras, in these times of misfortune, the consensus was in place.
 
The twelve divinities, which it was customary to designate under the name of Gods Knights, had taken the patronage of five orders of priest-warriors with well-defined powers and functions. The chiefs of these orders were chosen from the reigning family of Havenor. Here's what the legend says:
 
"They were six, six brothers whose legend has retained all the names. Obeying the commandments of the twelve celestial powers, they divided the powers.
"The eldest, the fiery and colossal Yvrian, decided to take the lead of human armies and founded the Purple Order. His protectors were Anton, Peristemus, Belrog the Impetuous, Zabroch and Ebrone. All these gods, former protectors of the kingdom of Havenor, were very impressed by the will and courage of Yvrian.
"His younger brother, Dromir, a little weaker than his brother, but smarter and focused on emotions, founded the Order of the Temple. He set himself up as protector of Havenor's prosperity but the gods did not want him as leader. Three Gods gave him his support: Cochime, Gorniard and Anaïle. The latter had a special affection for Dromir.
"The next two, Selrune and Gelrone, were twin brothers. A great friendship bound them. Selrune was appointed chief of Havenor. Selrune swore to Gelrone that this difference would not be enough to separate them and that their families would remain forever bound. This is why Gelrone founded the Havenorian Guard (later to become the Imperial Guard), most of whose members are the descendants of the two families of Selrune and Gelrone. Two Gods Knights decided to support this new order: Ierophan and Avrielle. This couple decided to establish themselves protector of the house of Selrune and Gelrone.
"There were two brothers left: Esole and Ugarn. Both hesitated about their conduct because the two divinities that remained were unknown to them. One of them, a vast stormy shadow with reflections of flames, terrified the Havenorians while the other, a strange greenish fog with liquid reflections, seemed to fascinate them. Finally, Esole chose to pledge allegiance to the green shade that he named Jade because of its colour. This god or goddess granted him protection and Esole founded the Order of Jade, an order devoted to mystery and secret struggles. Ugarn and the other divinity faced each other: the latter spoke and said terrible things. Ugarn, the last to have chosen, was invested with many powers and received the knowledge of the mastery of the Dragons, but he was condemned to secrecy and his face remained forever hidden to the face of mortals. He founded the Order of the Dragon. He was the only member while all the other orders had already found thousands of members.
"All the brothers swore allegiance to Selrune as well as to the twelve Gods Knights. Curiously, only Esole, lost in the contemplation of his divinity, took no part in the pronunciation of the dreadful and eternal oath. Only at the end, he raised his sword like the others and swore allegiance to Selrune and all his descendants.
" It is said that at the end of the oath, while five brothers waved their swords towards Selrune, several hundred Dragons arrived from the south above Tir Kavéras, under the orders of Azard, the Dragon God. Ugarn was finally able to found the order of the Dragon Knights.
 
Shortly after the revelation of Tir Kavéras, the Havenor armies, joined by others, began to break the isolation of the city. For nearly fifty years, these armies undertook a laborious reconquest of the plains of Ovolan to the mountains. In 295, the army of Tir Kavéras, led by the Havenorians and the Finlond, occupied all Ovolan as well as the south of the Stone Pass. There, the progression suddenly stopped for nearly forty years because the Black Gods sent whole contingents of Creatures of the Night, undead, giants and their armies of Goblins and Trolls. Thanks to a flawless organization, the battalions of Havenor and Finlond were able to stand up to such enemies and allow a semblance of peace to return to Tir Kavéras and Ovolan.

Unfortunately, in 150 before BM, new Black Hordes came out of Hoornal, crossed the Ne-Hebel, and settled in Irenimelan. From now on, the armies of the free world would have to fight on two fronts. The situation was getting worse. At the same time, old forgotten deities came out of their sleep and rallied to the armies on the move while Finlond found two Stones of Firmellan, the Stone of Knowledge and the Stone of Blood.

This influx of power allowed the armies stopped in the Stone Pass to take it and push forward into the Toleth Plains. In 94 before BM, Telabeth was taken back to its conquerors after bitter fights. The first kind of Havenor, Téphéren 1st, was crowned in the year 10 before BM.
 
But the war continued. For several years now, the Black Hordes had been retreating northwards into the heart of the Green Lands. In the south, peace gradually returned. In Ovolan and Tir Kaveras, one could live all one's life hearing only a distant sound of war.

Some years before the Battle of Mistarel, the Princes of Havanors and the Finlond, who foresaw a strategic retreat by the Black Hordes, undertook a vast lifting of armies on a continental scale. This immense concentration of men, food and equipment then entered the depths of the forest, setting up camps and drawing roads to meet their enemy.
This meeting took place around an old little Angrist village whose name would sound with glory in the centuries to come: Mistarel. 

[[introduction-black-age-mistarel]]
##### The Battle of Mistarel

Followed closely by the armies of Havenor and the Finlond, the Black Hordes had entrenched themselves on heights in the centre of the Green Lands. Armed with millions of Hobgoblins, Goblins, Trolls, Giants, Dragons and other Horrors from the Non-Life, supported by their deities in person, the Black Hordes saw the organized masses of the armies of the free world come to them. At their head were the king of Havenor, Téphéren 1st  and two princes of Finlond, Sentian Abrogine and Ydriss Nalane, both in possession of Firmellan Stones.

The Battle of Mistarel took over three years and killed millions.
Staked with conquests by one camp as on another, sometimes interrupted by long truces, it spread over several hundred kilometres. The belligerents fought on foot or in the air, by arms, fire or magic. Sorcery was employed in such a large quantity that the environs of Mistarel still carry the indelible trace of it in the form of Pockets of Chaos.
 
Specialized books abound on the subject and scholars have spent their whole life studying it. It turns out that the battle took place mainly in three phases. During the first months, the two armies were content to take up positions in the Green Lands, one to the north, the other to the south in the plains. Very little fighting took place in the region, most of the operations took place in the west, in the marshes of Havalan. There, as the Black Hordes reorganized into Origon, a massive assault by the Havenor Dragons allowed the capture and liberation of the Toleth Gorge. At the same time, the Noroths, taking advantage of the invaders' lack of attention, revolted and liberated Belgaroth from the yoke of the Dark Gods.
 
From then on, the Sarn Pass, easy to control, became a trap for the Black Hordes. The only passage left to them was through the Green Lands. The two armies advanced in the depths of the great primary forest. There followed a rather vague period when the enemy columns met sporadically without a real front being formed. The two staffs continued to want to strengthen their backs before launching the general assault.

It seemed almost obvious that neither side wanted to retreat to fight in the lowlands and that the main attack would take place in the middle of the forest.
 
Gradually, the pressure of the two armies tightened around Mistarel, long since in ruins and abandoned in the first battles. The Black Hordes took possession of it from the beginning, transforming it into a real fortress. It was from there that they initiated the first assault. Strongly camped on the defensive, the Knights' Orders held good. On the eastern wing Finlond armies, supported by the Dragons and the magic of two Stones, overflowed the Black Hordes from the east, forcing them to release their assault on the centre. It is from this period that dates the establishment of the true front of the Battle of Mistarel. The summer of the first year of the battle began and an intense heat overwhelmed all the fighters. The second phase of the battle was announced.
 
Face to face, the two armies delivered during fifteen months assaults on assaults. The wild magic crawled on the ground, the lightning rays in the sky gave a glimpse of the swirling fighting of the dragons, the days were darkened by smoke and the nights were illuminated by the flames. From behind the two armies came supplies, equipment and new recruits. It was a terrifying showdown, on which the future of the world depended. Any retreat would have meant defeat at this stage of operations.

The situation of the front evolved only very little. Sorcerers and magicians on both sides improved their spells day after day, and there came a time when the magical effects were so violent that conventional armies could no longer hold their positions. As the rear reorganized, the wizards, Dragons, and Orders of Havenor took over the fate of combat under this deluge of magic.

Opposite, the Black Hordes probably made their first mistake, or rather two simultaneous faults. First, they let their conventional armies, formed of Goblins and Hobgoblins, continue the fight. Submerged by magic, they offered no resistance to the flood of fire and horror and the Black Hordes weakened accordingly. The magic of the Dark Gods was very dependent on their own power so it diminished very quickly. In addition, their concentration focused on the terrain of the magic battle and forgot about the rest.
 
This certainly explains the ease with which the armies of Havenor and Finlond counterattacked from Havalan, bypassing the main theatre of operations, directly attacking the rear of the Black Hordes. At that time, the situation of the Dark Gods was untenable. The entrenched Mistarel camp was abandoned and a retreat began to the north. Very slow at first, it accelerated as the Dark Gods and Giants' Gods quarrelled and abandoned their troops. The Havenorians and Finlond troops reached the plains of Origon without a single additional fight. The battle of Mistarel was over!
 
A pursuit race started in Origon but the Black Hordes managed to regain the Desolation without any loss because the Allied armies had to reorganize all their supply lines through the Green Lands and the Sarn Pass.
This interval of time was enough for the Dark Gods to subdue the Gods of the Giants and reorganize themselves in the ancient fortresses.
The Finlond, galvanized by the power of the Stones, did not listen to the precautionary advice and engaged in the Black Lands in pursuit of their enemies. In the heart of darkness, the counter-offensive was terrible, the two stones of Knowledge and Blood were lost and very few Finlond came back, the survivors carried in them a terrible curse that would pursue them until the extinction of their entire race.

[[introduction-havenor]]
#### The age of Havenor

Following their immense defeat, the Dark Gods isolated themselves in their strongholds of the Desolation and were forgotten ... for a time. With the failure of the Finlond, the Havenorian forces found themselves the only depositories of the victory.

For many centuries, the history of the world would merge with the one of Havenor ...
 
In fact, as soon as the last battles were over, Havenor was only made up of a handful of knights grouped around their prince Tepheren, in the devastated lands of Origon. Technically, the latter was the heir to a crown that had ceased to be worn for a thousand years. All the lands that extended from Origon to the Straits of Sepp had fallen into the hands of warlords or skilful opportunists. The victors were without land. In Havenor and elsewhere, society had collapsed. The power had fallen back into the hands of a multitude of warlords; anarchy was total. If the Black Age was over, the world was still to be rebuilt.
 
Forty years after the Battle of Mistarel, the Knights of Havenor stormed the city of Telabeth, which had fallen under the tyrannical rule of an obscure adventurer. There, in the only building that had remained almost upright since the Dark Ages, the Knights of Havenor swore allegiance to Prince Tepheren (then over eighty years old) and crowned him. Through arms and diplomacy, the Prince's heirs took almost a century to gain control of the Toleth Plain.
 
Thus, in 135 AD, the kingdom of Havenor occupied all the plain of Toleth, the Green Lands to the Ravine of the Battle, the forests of Everguenn and the Marches of Helm to Orina.
 
The Stone Pass was occupied by numerous small fiefs of brigand lords. It was child's play for the Knights Templar to mount them against each other, and soon, under the guise of pacifying the region, Havenor took control (eminently strategic) of the Stone Pass. It was at the end of the year 161.
 
At the same time, from 140 to 180, during the reign of King Etros, the Knights concluded many diplomatic or commercial agreements with neighbouring countries. The kingdom of Irenimelan was one of those nations which concluded many agreements with Havenor. This rich and powerful nation depended on a very strict feudal system. The Knights used this state of affairs to gain control of this country. Thus in 194, the only daughter of King Beolphas of Irenimelan married the future king of Havenor, Tredicsian, whose true identity had been masterfully hidden. And at the coronation of Tredicsian, Irenimelan became an integral part of Havenor! It is Tredicsian who first took the title of emperor.
 
It was by such maneuvers, during the centuries that followed, that Havenor seized, by force, cunning or diplomacy, all his territories. In 221, Hanrgonion and the Ord Marshes were conquered by the regular armies of the empire. At the beginning of the fourth century, Havenor laid hands on the kingdoms south of Stone Pass, thus securing control of the Sepp Strait. And in 317, surrounded on all sides by the empire, prince Tomal of Tir Kavéras offered the keys of his city to the emperor Konrad de Havenor.

In 421, taking advantage of the weakness of the other empire, Norvolan, the armies of Havenor seized the north of the island of Sebanarole, the future province of Norion, thanks to the Knights but without any battle. There stopped the conquests of the empire. In fact, the neighbouring countries, those on the west coast (Belgaroth, Havalan or Roniorh) were starting to groan as well as the empire of Norvolan. The rulers of Havenor and their advisers were well aware that it was impossible to control by force such a territory. So Havenor turned to commerce and diplomacy (with no more ulterior motives this time). His power was stronger than ever. No nation in the world could compete in terms of trade, influence, or military force with the Havenor empire.
 
The empire was rich, prosperous and worked without major trouble. Then began the era of great works. In 525 AD BM began the construction of the Toleth Road, an impressive paved road that runs along the majestic Telabeth River in Polen. In the same year also began the work of development of the road that crossed the Stone Pass. Imperial inns and garrisons were built all along the Pass in order to prevent the attacks of brigands. The construction of the Toleth road was completed in 536 while the construction of the Stone Pass reached Tir Kavéras in 587. Other similar works took place at that time, such as the paved road that connects Tir Kavéras to Port Fangno along the coast.
 
But the most important of all the great works done by the Havenor Empire at its peak began in 525: the construction of the Erman Bridge. It was not finished until 715. Tens of thousands of men participated in the project. Among them, there were also many magicians. It was an enterprise defying the imagination: to build a bridge linking Tir Eshel and Irenimelan to the province of Norion on the island of Sébanarole. This work was therefore to cross the hundred kilometres of the Sepp Strait, which reaches here up to a thousand meters deep. Only powerful magic could allow this work of titans to be realized. 
 
At the end of the 6th century, the Havenor Empire was at its peak. Nothing seemed to threaten it: his armies, powerful and numerous, controlled a vast territory. Merchants and explorers went to the far reaches of the known world and beyond. But all this power, concentrated in the hands of only a few men, the Emperor and the Knights, could not last forever. Came the dark hours of the decadence of the empire

[[introduction-havenor-decadence]]
##### The decadence of Havenor

In 612, Emperor Bressen II decided to be considered a deity. He was encouraged, it is said, by senior members of the Imperial Guard. At first, only a few discrete altars were placed throughout the empire; the priests of the emperor were the Knights of the Imperial Guard. In 640, Bressen II declared that he was the descendant of a long line of gods and that the time had come for the divine nature of the emperors to come into the open. The imperial cult then became more and more important. Despite the warnings of some Knights (especially those of the Dragon), the Emperor Bressen II, in 645, two years before his death, was considered the Thirteenth God Knight of Havenor. In the last year of his life, he built a huge mausoleum on the shores of the Toleth. He had the ashes of his ancestor Tredicsian transferred there before being buried there a few months later.
 
His successor, Terben I, continued to practice the worship of the imperial person. In 652 he demanded to be called the Thirteenth and the First. That is to say, he considered himself the leader of the Gods Knights. From then on, riots broke out everywhere in the country, and in particular at Telabeth. Some of these revolts were led by former Knights of the Temple and the Order of the Dragon. But, with the support of a majority of the Orders and the Legion, the emperor easily crushed all these uprisings. It should be noted that the Dragons were never used during this turbulent period.
 
Like his father, Terben gave disproportionate importance to his funeral home. He enlarged the great mausoleum on the banks of the Toleth. This large building required twelve years of work and the services of thousands of artisans and artists. When Terben was buried there in 685, the ceremonies were so lavish that nearly a tenth of the empire's wealth was swallowed up. His son Adressande continued the worship for ten years. When he died, the young Garanis succeeded him. He had been educated in the great university of Tir Kavéras, alongside Enien and former Knights who remained faithful to their ideals. When he came to power, he began by reforming the empire and putting an end to his divinity status. Four months after his coronation,he had to go and fight a great revolt in the eastern provinces of Irenimelan. Garanis the Younger was killed in the middle of the fighting by an arrow in the head. His funeral at Telabeth was grandiose, almost as sumptuous as that of his grandfather. His successor was his younger brother, an ambitious young man whose name has remained famous: Adrian the Scarlet.
 
Crowned in 696, at the age of nineteen, he began a reign of terror in his palace of Telabeth. He gained his nickname by slaughtering all his opponents one by one, sometimes with his own hands, with the help of some of his most loyal friends. In 701, during a huge ceremony, he became King of the Gods and demanded huge tributes from all the provinces of the empire. He began by enlarging the mausoleum of his ancestors and then changed his mind. He decided to erect a new monument, a little north of Moganem. From all the provinces of the empire, tens of thousands of workers came running, more or less willingly. The scope of the work was such that early on the use of magic was recommended. Adrian asked the services of the magical guilds in Tir Kavéras, Tir Eshel and Tornbush. From 703 to 715, a huge temple began to rise above the plains, higher and higher. Nobody worried too much when the Havenor Knights began to lose their powers.
 
Adrian had more and more contacts with the Tornbush mages. Some of these began to suggest to him, never in a direct way, to use Non-Life to truly acquire the powers of a God. At first, the emperor, still quite young, was frightened and executed the wizards.
 
The years passed. The mausoleum of Adrian rose higher and higher. The magic used was powerful, and the empire engulfed an immense fortune in this construction. Taxes became heavier. The people, overwhelmed, began to revolt. The Knights, deprived of their magic powers but not of their fighting power, became a formidable force of repression. The region of Curamain was the scene of dreadful bloodbaths in 723. Everywhere now, King-God Adrian had to fight in his empire, deserving day after day his nickname of Scarlet.
 
Time passed and the emperor began to be old. In 750, old and sick, anguished by his approaching end, he summoned the sorcerers of Tornbush to initiate him to the mysteries of Non-Life. Then began the years of Discord. The Gods Knights completely abandoned the country of Havenor. Adrian reigned as an absolute and cruel tyrant over his people, whose revolts he accused of being conspiracies organized by the Dark Gods. In 753 took place the first human sacrifices in the Temple of Adrian. The blood was used to sanctify the last building of the building. It is said that on the night of the sacrifices, the sky remained burning over all the region of Moganem.
 
In 762, as the armies of the Dark Gods moved northward, Adrian, halfway between life and death, demanded more and more sacrifices from his people. But the Emperor, in his mad ambition, had become more and more isolated. He stayed longer and longer in his own tomb, more and more alone. The following year, the province of Irenimelan fell into the hands of the armies of Hoornal. The emperor remained cloistered in his temple, and gradually sank into a murderous madness; the empire was left to itself. In 765, a group of Dragons Knights and Imperial Guards kidnapped the young Constain IV from Telabeth's palace. A few weeks later, the imperial city fell and was completely razed. Adrian Scarlet was considered dead and the power passed to Constain. The latter, surrounded by the remnants of the Knights, fled to the south, to the Stone Pass and then to Tir Kavéras. The Great War of Men had begun.
 
As for Adrian's fate, no one knows what happened to him. After the war, what remained of his tomb were devastated ruins, haunted by magic. All the divinations were in vain: it is said that the ghost of Scarlet still haunts the lands of the empire, threatening with his fiery gaze the poor mutts meeting him by bad luck.

[[introduction-great-war-of-men]]
#### The Great War of Men

Since the end of the Black Age, Origon had remained a poor land, split in many fiefs. Quarrels or wars between neighbours were incessant. In theory, the Emperor of Origon reigned from Tornbush on all lands stretching from the Bay of Soils to the Marshes of the Oblivion. In theory only. So when countless hobgoblin armies, accompanied by Goblins, Trolls, and a few Giants, supported from Hokromûr by the Dark Gods and on the ground by some Dark and Red Dragon Creatures, the Origon Empire did not offer not a lot of resistance. The assault began in the middle of the winter of 762 after BM. The following winter, the city of Tornbush fell and became the new headquarters of the troops of Hokromûr.

From there, the armies of the Dark Gods descended to the south. At the same time, another army, coming this time from the mountains of Hoornal ravaged the countries of Saphris and Veshan and arrived in 763 in Irenimelan. Despite a brief and heroic resistance, Havenor's armies were swept away.
 
The attack had been well thought out, the assault had been massive and fast. Almost none of the Empire's commanders had known a war, and they knew nothing how to face such an invasion. The city of Telabeth fell in 765 into the hands of the enemy and was completely razed. The then emperor, the young Constain IV, found refuge in the city of Tir Kavéras with his family and the rest of his armies. In 770, despite the resistance that the Knights put in the Stone Pass, the great city of Tir Kavéras was besieged. In seven years, Havenor had gone from being the world's most powerful empire to being a besieged city
 
At the same time, Hoornal's armies were crossing the Erman Bridge and occupying the province of Norion. From there, the Hobgoblin armies crossed the mountains of Karkater and Ohm, and even though they suffered many casualties, they were still powerful enough to attack and defeat the empire of Norvolan. Norvolan survived only in his southern islands, where his navy had remained intact and was still powerful.
 
Over most of the continent, Hokromûr ruled unchallenged. The siege of Tir Kavéras continued, more terrible and painful day after day. The inhabitants of the martyred city owed their safety only to the mighty walls of their city, to the tenacity of their fighters, and to the provisions regularly brought them by the ships of Norvolan, after having foiled the surveillance of the enemy fleets.
 
But in 840, 70 years after the beginning of the siege, many inhabitants of the city, exhausted, chose the exodus. Then took place the Grand Rally of Tir Kavéras. This provoked many quarrels, sometimes deadly clashes took place, but it happened that a group of nearly twenty thousand people went to sea at the end of the summer of that year. These people had for the most part different destinies: some perished, victims of Hobgobelin fleets or storms, but the others went forward to found new nations like Hupalong or Kérédé, joined by many other refugees who left later from other regions of the world. It was the time of great migrations around the world. 
 
And yet the wind of war was slowly turning. If the Ardains of Véglénion and the Angrist of the Mirogrond or Karatras had not been worried by the war, it seemed that it could not last. The Goblin troops were beginning to venture into the mountains of western Havenor, and the Angrists were already facing the Hobgoblins in their valleys. They could not remain neutral anymore. In fact, only the people of Mirogrond and Heranas really reacted. The Angrist of Karatras confined themselves to standing on the spot, in their mountains and their fortresses while those of Zorost bury themselves deep in their subterranean cities, where their enemies could not venture. By the year 840, contacts had been established between Mirogrond and Véglénion. For if the people of Véglénion were protected, it was thanks to the Angrist mountains and if they came to succumb to the enemy, nothing or no one could oppose the annihilation of the Eniens.
 
For five years the two peoples prepared for the counteroffensive. In 845, the Eniens crossed the Karatras Bridge by ways known of the Angrist alone. The armies of Mirogrond and Veglénion, united, rushed on the Helm Marches to cut the supply routes of the enemy in the Stone Pass. At the same time, to the south, Angrist armies descended from the mountains of Heranas, joined the troops of Tir Kavéras and chased the goblin legions from the plains of the Nesh peninsula. Thus began the battles of the Stone Pass. They lasted nearly a whole year, from 845 to 846, at the end of which the enemy was repulsed as far as the plains of Toleth. The counterattack was not confined to the Helm's Marches alone, it had rapidly spread to the east, thanks to fierce battles in the marshes of Ord then in the forests of Everguenn. in 851, emerging from the mountains, accompanied by the Eniens, joined by the Havenorian armies from the Stone Pass, the Angrist of Mirogrond were master of all the plain of Toleth in the south of the river. Telabeth, in ruins, was still in the hands of the enemy and did not fall until 855, thanks to the tenacious siege of the Knights of the Imperial Guard.
 
In the years that followed, the Havenorian armies turned their efforts towards the west, towards the old Belgaroth. In 854, Port Belgaroth was abandoned by the Hobgoblins. From then on, the knights were able to use the sea way again to harass the enemy. The battle went by sea to Norlanien. High achievements were then made in Origon by the Jade Knights. Hundreds of these brave warriors entered 856 in the heart of the country of their enemies and went to take refuge after many adventures in the thick forests of the Green Lands. There they waited their time.
 
At the same time, in the year 855 exactly, the prophet Nephros won the title of Living God of Chargos and led the revolt against the invading Gobelins and the evil human tribes of Mung. This new situation to the east enabled Havenor to concentrate his military efforts on the Toleth River front.
 
It was also in 855 that the Toleth Battles began. They lasted five years, during which the two parties did not cease to cross the river on both sides, sometimes victorious, sometimes making a hasty retreat. It was five terrible, weary years, when war was only played on both sides of a river. There were days when the waters of Toleth were red with the blood of the dead. Thanks to the help of the Angrist of Mirogrond, of the Enien of Véglénion who fought far from their country, thanks to the organization, the tenacity and the union of the Knights of Havenor, the enemy was definitively repulsed beyond the river, into the forests of the Green Lands. For Goblin cohorts, a long and perilous retreat was beginning. The Jade Knights were waiting for them in the dark valleys of the Ravines of the Battle, had been waiting for almost four years, and they were without mercy.
 
It was the end of the war. The armies from Hoortnog had been destroyed. The Knights finally arrived at Origon and there they realized that their enemy had disappeared: no dragon, no dark creature, and no black deity was waiting for them. The country was deserted. No one ever really knew why the Gods of Hoortnog and Hoornal gave up the fight, while their armed forces, massed in the swamps of the Desolation, still remained formidable. It was hypothesized that these Gods had been afraid of being vanquished, of being permanently annihilated. But in fact, it seemed more reasonable to think that these gods had lost much of their power in this war.
 
Thus the Dark Gods and the Gods of the Giants had returned to their nightmare citadels, to the desolation of Hoortnog or to the suffocating depths of Hoornal. Abandoned, evil Dragons and dark creatures went into oblivion.
 
A new era was coming, one in which the creatures of the past (Gods, Dragons and creatures of the Non-Life) would no longer come to haunt the civilizations of the future; this war had marked the end of one era and the beginning of another. It was the end of the age of the gods and the beginning of that of men. That is why this war was later called the Great War of Men, that of Men against the Gods.
 
But nothing has been forgotten. The Dark Gods are always holed up in their strongholds, the Gods of the Giants are still wandering in their desolations, the Evil Dragons are watching, and the Dark Creatures are plunged into a sleep that is not eternal. So the Havenor Knights watch, they know that all is not won. The monsters of the past are still guarding the gates of the future.

[[introduction-modern-times]]
#### Modern times

With the end of the Great War of Men, Havenor's influence, while still considerable, declined. Other powers have emerged and will become more and more important in the years to come.
 
In 881, the reorganization of the Havenor structure took place at Telabeth: only the Toleth plains, less Havalan, which remained independent, were considered integral parts of the empire. The other provinces became autonomous. They remained subject to the protection of Knights' Orders but acquire their independence in other areas. 
While certain regions like the Ord Marshes remain as provinces administered by a governor appointed by Telabeth, others like Tir Kavéras or the Helm's Marches almost become independent of the central power.
Paradoxically, this easing of imperial centralization strengthened Havenor while reducing the apparent threat to its distrustful neighbours: Norvolan and Belgaroth. At the same time, Irénimélan, a province traditionally hostile to the central government, is experiencing a quieter period and the rebels are suddenly less well perceived by the population.
 
After the Civil War in 1059, Belgaroth, despite its tiny size, asserted itself as the rising power, using in conjunction with its maritime power and commercial strength. Nevertheless, Norvolan and this small nation are almost in a state of war because it is known that the small coastal republic armed and supports many pirate groups (corsairs from his point of view) to harass imperial convoys in Eklem or the islands of the Southern Ocean.

Havenor's northern neighbour, beyond the hostile stretches of the Green Lands, Origon, was almost forgotten, known only to serve as a gateway to the Black Hordes during both wars. Since the end of the Great War, the Green Lands have also been roamed by the Argantes Lords, troops of warriors from Origon seeking to infiltrate Havenor, Havalan or Kantong, to loot and kill. But things are changing in the north since the kingdom of Asman began its expansion and announced its claims on the imperial, albeit symbolic, throne of Tornbush.
 
Since the end of the war, Havenor has faced many threats, both inside and on its borders.

In the Stone Pass, the situation is gradually being stabilized against the Angrist of Karatras but things could get worse if the Brigands Princes of Hanrgonion would join their neighbours.

But the main threat came in the middle of the 12th century, from Wemgang and the Assidiges. Having already invaded Pléthan once, they never stopped trying again. The deadly fighting on the edge of the forest has not designated any winner to date. The situation becomes very critical today and justifies a great military agitation throughout the Empire.
 
Over the past centuries, many perspectives have also opened up for humanity, which is constantly expanding with the discovery of new lands to the west and south.
For now, the colonization of Western lands is the exclusive preserve of Vetermjord but it would be surprising if no one else cared. In particular Belgaroth.

In the south, Norvolan protects its exclusivity on the southern continent using its marine power and several colonization experiments have been attempted. Everything have so far failed because of climatic conditions and the unexpected presence of Hobgoblin tribes. But the empire will certainly not give up the riches promised by this immense continent.
