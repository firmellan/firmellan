## Introduction

According to the magicians of Glantr, who have studied the structure of the universe for centuries, there is not one world, but an infinity, all very different from each other. Firmellan, the world where they live, is only one of them even if it takes a particular importance since it is their world.

According to these same magicians, all these worlds bathe in an inconsistent sea which one names the Chaos. There, in this "nowhere” between the universes, no rule exists, no law can apply.

Firmellan is a world that exists, according to the oldest legends, for a little more than ten thousand years. It is said that it was created by the Gods or that the Gods came from another universe to settle there; in any case, they contributed to create the flora and fauna that make Firmellan unique among all the universes.
 
This document will describe what everyone knows about Firmellan. After giving a brief overview of the history of the world as well as a general description of the Firmellan world, one will detail one by one all the regions and regions of the vast universe.
 
Many points are deliberately left in the shadows because the truth is known only to the gods themselves. These "mysteries of Firmellan" will be unveiled, one by one, in other supplements.
