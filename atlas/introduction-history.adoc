### A brief history of Firmellan

In the history of Havenor, several dates were taken in turn as references. The first used was the date of the creation of the city of Alceone, future Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM), in all the chronic slates.

Subsequently, the Fall (4315 BM) was considered a new start of the calendar although some Elden peoples consider the period of the Exile of the Gods (3004 BM) to be more valid.

Today, only one date is used as a reference: the Battle of Mistarel (BM). This titanic fight decided the fate of the world and marks the defeat of the Dark Gods against the United Humans and Ardains.

Historians, whether from Tir Kaveras or elsewhere, have become accustomed to viewing the history of the world from the perspective of eight great ages.

The Age of the Gods extends from the creation of the world (or since the arrival of the divinities on Firmellan) until the creation of the Ardains and the foundation of Tir Kavéras. The gods have left no archive or less written record (except the mythical tablets of Qsiros), their city of Ambera, having completely disappeared, this period is extremely vague, closer to mythology than history.

The Ardains dominate all the time which goes from the foundation of Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM) until the Fall. This period is therefore aptly named the Age of the Ardains even though they remain the faithful servants of their divine creators.

The Fall is a cataclysmic event, the extent of which certainly did not last more than a few days or weeks, in 4315 BC But we give its name to the chaotic and uncertain era that separates this catastrophe from the Exile of the Gods (-3004).

The Hastir Age begins in the 30th century before BM with the birth of the first great human kingdoms south of Hoortnog (Kaarmyin then Hastir in the 26th century)... It is also called the Age of the Struggle. It is indeed marked by the rise and the glory of Hastir, by the alliance of Humans, Ardains and Dragons against the Dark Gods but also by the omnipresence of the magical forces on the world. The greatest magicians of history have indeed lived at this time. One of them, Aturdane, will put an end to this period by the total destruction of Hastir and the Second Draconic Schism, which ended the Alliance.

In the mentalities of the inhabitants of Firmellan, the Black Age still marks many consciences. Spread over more than ten centuries, it is synonymous with the annihilation of all the liberties and domination of the Black Gods throughout the known world. Starting with the sudden death of Hastir and Second Schism of the Dragons at the end of the eleventh century before BM (certainly -1026), it ends at the Battle of Mistarel (year zero).

Although Havenor is still the largest nation in the world of Firmellan, in terms of power and influence, it is considered that it was once more powerful, enough in any case to give its name to a whole period. The Age of Havenor begins during the Battle of Mistarel (year zero) but several books place the beginning of this period in -235, at the time of the revelation of the Knights Gods.

The Great War of Men, the second global confrontation of Humans and Ardains against the Dark Gods, begins in 762, during the assault of the Black Hordes against Origon but some historians do it begins in 765, date of the capture of Telabeth, even in 770, date of the beginning of the siege of Tir Kavéras.

The present era (1383 after BM) is included in what is called the Modern Times. They officially begin in 855, date of the Battles of the Toleth which marked the victory of the Knights of Havenor on the Black Hordes and the end of the Great War of the Men.

#### The Age of the Gods

No chronicle, no story or even no legend tells the beginnings of Firmellan. The only information available is fragmentary, gleaned by the Ardains from the Gods of the time of their glory.
For example, no one knows if Firmellan was created by the Gods or if they just settled there. This theological questioning still divides the priests, even within the same cult. But direct testimonies collected from the Dark Gods by the Meïktal priests seem to corroborate the second hypothesis, that of the arrival of the Gods of Firmellan more than a hundred centuries ago. But these testimonies are obviously questionable.
Without speaking of the origin of the Gods, several facts are proved by the different chronic slates. The Gods would have contributed to create many varieties of fauna and flora on Firmellan, until ending with their masterpiece, the creation of the Ardains. They built an immense city in the heart of the world, the mythical Ambera, which has now been lost. We must not forget that the Gods of Firmellan are very numerous, certainly more than five thousand, and they formed a true civilisation. According to the early Ardains, the gods formed families and some births, very rare however, are reported. Of course, throughout this population, many divinities were detached from others by their influence and power. There were in particular three, Mirofrans, Alantéis and Yemorlane, who formed the Triad, the governing body of life in Ambera.
Since that time, the divine people have known dissensions. First, there are Gods who did not want to live in Ambera and went exploring the big world. Later, deprived of worshipers, they faded away little by little and their names were forgotten. These gods are called Zephyr Gods and it is said that one can hear their words in the sigh of the wind in the desert regions.
Twelve gods, Alcéone and his followers, went south on the shores of the Southern Ocean, where the island of Sebanarole did not yet exist, and founded a second divine city: the future Tir Kavéras. Alcéone made it a haven of beauty and the centre of his creative work. He returned to Ambera, however, when the time came for the creation of the Ardains.
 
More disturbing, announcing all the misfortunes to come, a group of about fifty Gods, perhaps more, went to the north, driven out of Ambera by their peers. They had committed the crime of conducting magical experiments that had gone wrong. These gods of Yûr, from the name of the domain they founded in the north, were eager to know and had explored many areas of knowledge. Always more adventurous, they opened the doors to unholy knowledge: the control of the forces of Non-Life, antithesis of all that the Gods of Ambera were trying to build on Firmellan.
In the beginning, the Gods of Yûr, led by Justan and Edern, only sought to increase their knowledge, but their exile led them to pursue other goals, of which revenge was certainly part. But the Gods of Ambera were still too many and too strong; the Gods of Yûr knew to be patient. They led, however, terrifying experiences in the north of the world and ruined so much that country that it was called later the Desolation, a true region of nightmare, haunted the grotesque creations of Non-Life.
 
Nearly nine thousand years before BM, the Gods decided to create their masterpiece, a race of servants charged with worshiping them. In the heart of Ambera, the Gods set to work and created the Ardains. The gods were so pleased with their work that they decided to take their appearance. So the true aspect of the Ancient Gods was definitely lost. One can however think, given the forms that the Black Gods willingly borrow, that they must have been very varied.
