### A brief history of Firmellan

In the history of Havenor, several dates were taken in turn as references. The first used was the date
of the creation of the city of Alceone, future Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM), in all the chronic slates.

Subsequently, the Fall (4315 BM) was considered a new start of the calendar although some Elden
peoples consider the period of the Exile of the Gods (3004 BM) to be more valid.

Today, only one date is used as a reference: the Battle of Mistarel (BM). This titanic fight decided
the fate of the world and marks the defeat of the Dark Gods against the United Humans and Ardains.

Historians, whether from Tir Kaveras or elsewhere, have become accustomed
to viewing the history of the world from the perspective of eight great ages.

The Age of the Gods extends from the creation of the world (or since the arrival of
the divinities on Firmellan) until the creation of the Ardains and the
foundation of Tir Kavéras. The gods have left no archive or less written
record (except the mythical tablets of Qsiros), their city of Ambera,
having completely disappeared, this period is extremely vague, closer
to mythology than history. 

The Ardains dominate all the time which goes from the foundation of
Tir Kavéras (9200 years before BM) until the Fall. This period is
therefore aptly named the Age of the Ardains even though they remain
the faithful servants of their divine creators.

The Fall is a cataclysmic event, the extent of which certainly did not
last more than a few days or weeks, in 4315 BC But we give its name to
the chaotic and uncertain era that separates this catastrophe from the
Exile of the Gods (-3004).

The Hastir Age begins in the 30th century before BM with the birth of
the first great human kingdoms south of Hoortnog (Kaarmyin then Hastir
in the 26th century)... It is also called the Age of the Struggle. It is
indeed marked by the rise and the glory of Hastir, by the alliance of
Humans, Ardains and Dragons against the Dark Gods but also by the
omnipresence of the magical forces on the world. The greatest magicians
of history have indeed lived at this time. One of them, Aturdane,
will put an end to this period by the total destruction of Hastir and the Second Draconic Schism, which ended the Alliance.

In the mentalities of the inhabitants of Firmellan, the Black Age still marks many consciences. Spread over more than ten centuries, it is synonymous with the annihilation of all the liberties and domination of the Black Gods throughout the known world. Starting with the sudden death of Hastir and Second Schism of the Dragons at the end of the eleventh century before BM (certainly -1026), it ends at the Battle of Mistarel (year zero).

Although Havenor is still the largest nation in the world of Firmellan, in terms of power and influence, it is considered that it was once more powerful, enough in any case to give its name to a whole period. The Age of Havenor begins during the Battle of Mistarel (year zero) but several books place the beginning of this period in -235, at the time of the revelation of the Knights Gods.

The Great War of Men, the second global confrontation of Humans and Ardains against the Dark Gods, begins in 762, during the assault of the Black Hordes against Origon but some historians do it begins in 765, date of the capture of Telabeth, even in 770, date of the beginning of the siege of Tir Kavéras.

The present era (1383 after BM) is included in what is called the Modern Times. They officially begin in 855, date of the Battles of the Toleth which marked the victory of the Knights of Havenor on the Black Hordes and the end of the Great War of the Men.
